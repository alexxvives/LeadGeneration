# Session Handoff — current state & next steps

**Purpose:** the running "where we are" note so a new chat/session can pick up
without re-deriving context. `AGENTS.md` points every agent here. **Read this
first, and update the top block at the end of any session that changes state.**

> Keep it short. This is a pointer to truth (code + `docs/`), not a second copy
> of it. Durable decisions still live in `docs/decisions/` (ADRs + LEARNINGS).
